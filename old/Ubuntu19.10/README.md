# A set of shell script for installing a custom Linux system

I have a separate /home partition where all of my common programs (e.g., anaconda3, FSL, AFNI, LaTex, Easy fMRI, etc.) are located at /home/common

Further, some of the other apps such as PyCharm are located at /home/common/programs

The main goal of this script is to set up all software and environment, when I have a clean install Debian based Linux such as Ubuntu or Pop OS!

This is a personal project; feel free to use it :-)


Want a copy on your computer:

git clone https://gitlab.com/myousefnezhad/linuxscripts.git /home/common/install
