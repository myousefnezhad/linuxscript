Create a file at: /etc/network/if-up.d/fstab

Add this to it:

#!/bin/sh
mount -a
Make the file executable:

sudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/fstab
You are directing the system at boot time to issue a mount -a after the network stack is up and operation which if it's like a cifs mount in fstab is the reason your shares are not mounting at boot.
